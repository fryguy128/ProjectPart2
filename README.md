# Steady Hand Part 3
This project contains the scripts necessary to to complete the objectives of the steady hand project part 3. Each script from part 2 has been adjusted to act upon the data that was recorded for the first second and first ten seconds. A new script has been added that creates tables from the previous output and graphs the histograms. To create the LaTex document that uses nearly every script in this repository, run ./createTexDoc in the LaTex folder. This will only work if you keep the file structure the same.
